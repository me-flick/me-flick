### 💬✨Hi, I'm Meagan 

And, welcome to my 'portfolio' style GitHub. 

Feel free to take a look around, I will be adding more projects and things in the upcoming months.

- 🔭 ***I’m currently working on:*** Setting up a networking project, and getting my work deployed on an interactive site for visitors.
- 🌱 ***I’m currently learning:*** Best security practices and functionalities. Always learning, never stop! 
- 📫 ***How to reach me:*** Email, or LinkedIn! Check the side panel for those links.  
- ⚡ ***Fun fact:*** Lemons aren't naturally occurring, they were created through the breeding of bitter oranges and citrons. So we made lemons, then made lemonade. In the same way that: while most of my problems seem to be self-inflicted, I'll only solve them with a little perseverance.
